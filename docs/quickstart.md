# Quickstart

:bangbang: **WARNING**: Please read the chapter safety in the readme before use. 

## Setup

1. Securely mount CHUNKY-Rotisserie in safe environment, make sure it's lever can rotate freely
2. Connect CHUNKY-Rotisserie to Power: 230VAC at 50Hz with a 10A fuse
3. Power on the device - don't connect DMX yet!
4. Connect to the wifi access point "CHUNK" with the password "r0t1SS3r13.me" (AP only available for 5min. after boot)
5. In a webbroswer navigate to "192.168.04.01"
6. Choose a base channel for dmx communication (e.g. 500 means the device will respond to channels 501 - 506)
7. Choose a motor-mode (ramping speed). The heavier to object you're rotating the slower the ramp should be.
8. Restart CHUNKY-Rotisserie for the Settings to take effect
9. Ensure all relevant DMX-channels are set to 0!
10. Connect the DMX-Cable
11. Clear out of the danger zone and have fun rotating :smiley:

## Operating

1. Choose the operation-mode with channel 6 (e.g. if base channel was set to 500 this is 506)
2. Choose the maximum speed with channel 3
3. Operate with the other channels according to the chose mode
   1. e.g. in Continuous Rotation, changing channel 4 will rotate the motor clock wise relative to the set max speed. Changes in speed will happen slowly as the motor is ramping up and down to avoid internal damage.
