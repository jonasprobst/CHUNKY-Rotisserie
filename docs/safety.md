# Safety

## Savety Considerations

- Safety of the stage personell: provide emergency stop and ensure that in case of prolonged dmx communication errors or signal loss the motor is stopped.
- Implement Hardware safety features like fuses and curent limiting.
- Automated Stoping (Loosing DMX Connection, Current Sensor?, temperature sensor?)
- Lightningdesk Personell (Max Speed - Channel 3 to 0), **setup a set all 0 button on Desk**
- Housing of the device (grounded), choice of cables (big where needed), keeping things savely stored away
- Double saftey for things attached to shaft [like this](https://images.app.goo.gl/RfDvGF1uAmsQuWuMA)
- Seperate circuits for DMX Data and Device (Groundloop protection)
- Savety Checklist
